# Automatic-Vehicle-Monitoring-system-using-CAN-Protocal-and-Email-Alerting-System
This project is a Vehicle Monitoring System using the CAN protocol to collect real-time data (temperature, water level, IR, LDR) from slave modules. The master sends the data to an ESP8266, which parses it and sends email alerts when abnormal values are detected.
